# Hand Gesture Recognition with MediaPipe and OpenCV

This project aims to recognize hand gestures, specifically "thumbs up" and "thumbs down", using MediaPipe and OpenCV libraries in Python.

## Overview

Hand gesture recognition is an essential task in computer vision, with applications ranging from sign language translation to human-computer interaction. In this project, we leverage MediaPipe, an open-source library developed by Google, to detect hand landmarks accurately. We then use these landmarks to determine the hand gesture, specifically "thumbs up" and "thumbs down".

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

2. Run the `main.py` script:

3. Hold your hand in front of the camera and make a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" gesture.

4. The program will detect and display the recognized gesture in the terminal.
